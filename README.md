### Welcome and hello! ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Chaya Trapedo, and as an honors student at Yeshiva University, I constantly challenge myself to be curious, think creatively, and solve new problems. With a major in Computer Science and minors in Mathematics and Music, I bring a unique interdisciplinary approach to the world of software and data engineering.
